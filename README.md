# OpenCV_Introductory_Task
Computer vision is the process of capturing images using a camera, applying mathematical operations 
to the data, and from that, obtaining useful information. During the remaining project sessions we will 
follow this process:
. Capture an image from the camera
. Filter the image to isolate what is being looked for
. Analyse the filtered image
. Use the data from the analysed results to control the motion of the EEEBot
For this task, static images will be used instead of capturing frames from a camera.




 Introductory Task
Your task is to develop a program that can correctly identify the colour of the objects in each of the 
given images:
You will need to consider how to ignore the background and identify just the colour of the object. Try 
drawing a flowchart of the process you want to follow before you start programming.
Once you have a working program you should try it with your own images and extend it to detect a 
larger colour range (e.g. yellow, orange, purple, turquoise, pink).
You can use the HSVTool example to play with how different limits of Hue, Saturation and Value can 
be used to isolate single colours.
4. Assessment of the OpenCV Introductory Task
As mentioned, the described task must form a section of Lab Report 3. This section is worth 5% of the 
report and must include the following:
- Introduction
- Flowchart
- Discussion of the code with code snippets
- Output data and results
- Discussion of the results
- Conclusion
- Link to the full code e.g. Pastebin or GitHub
